### HARD
- Mark subreddits as favorites (no official API that I can find)
- Respond to inbox messages
- Get polls working
- Make subreddit title a search button
- Image upload when making posts/comments


### Medium
- Subscribe/unsubscribe to subreddit
- Subreddit icons on Subreddit List page


### Easy
- Indicate pinned posts and stickied comments
- Long press options to share posts and Comments
- Setting to change post title length
